General strategies
After you've moved forward in your learning, go back and redo an old assignment from scratch
Start by typing in code that you already know works, then make small changes to the code, predicting the output/change and then verifying if that assumption was correct
Ask someone else to walk you through their code without your computer in front of you, listening attentively and asking questions
Become a questioner, engage yourself in lectures and discussions by asking questions.
